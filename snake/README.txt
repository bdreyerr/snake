For my final project I decided to create a snake game in ruby using the 2D game framework gosu.

When brainstorming, I thought my MVP of the project would be to get the basic game functionality working.
I wanted the player to be able to control the snake with the arrow keys, move towards the apple, and whenever
the player ate an apple, the snake would increase in size and the score would go up.

Then once the MVP was completed, I would begin to add additional functionality to the game. Firstly, I wanted to change the graphics a little bit
to add some flare, I additionaly added some sounds to the game when you die or eat an apple. I included an apple sprite, and tried to draw my own snake 
sprite but chose to go with colored squares seeing as my art skills arent great. Then I wanted the game to also be two player. To do this I needed to 
create an additional snake class with some different properties and controls.





In order to run the game, I beleive you must have ruby installed as well as gosu. You can download gosu via rubyGems.

Once you have those installed run the game by running the command ruby maingame.rb in the command prompt.
